# Alfred Workflows (Optimzed for Alfred v4)
Alfred v4 Workflows. Here is a list of the **Alfred Workflows I use in my workflow**.
Most workflows are **made by me**. A few of them are based on work from others, in which case credits will be mentioned under "About this Workflow".

## Add To-Do to Things 3
*Based on the official culturedcode Quicksilver/Alfred script.*

![Alfred and Things 3 Screenshot](https://github.com/danielbahl/alfredv4/blob/master/Add-To-Do-to-Things-3-screenshot-1.png?raw=true)

### Getting started
**`+ Remember the milk`** creates a new TODO in inbox named "Remember the milk".

### Advanced Syntax

`title #tag1 #tag2 [project name/area name] ::note >duedate`

**Example:** `+ Remember the milk #groceries Shopping/Daily ::I love milk >20190616`

#### Notes
- Only existing tags can be added. This parameter is case-insensitive. If #tag1 doesnâ€™t exist, '#tag1' will be added to the to-doâ€™s title.
- To-dos can only be added to existing projects or areas. This parameter is case-insensitive. Projects or areas that donâ€™t already exist will be ignored entirely; the text wonâ€™t be added to the to-doâ€™s title.
- Format for the due date will reflect your Macâ€™s short date format. Check this in System Preferences > Language & Region > Advancedâ€¦ > Dates. Invalid due date formats will result in the parameterâ€™s text being added to the to-dos title.
- If youâ€™re using a dark theme for Alfred, thereâ€™s a white Inbox icon available in this Workflowâ€™s folder. Right-click the Workflow and click Show in Finder to find it.

## Bear
*Based on chrisbro/alfred-bear.*

## Emoji Search
*Based on James Sumners (jsumners/alfred-emoji) awesome work!* Optimized and edited a bit to fit my emoji needs :)

**Hotkey Enabled** Please note that this Workflow has the CMD+. hotkey enabled. So it's easy to find and insert emojis everywhere by using the keyboard shortcuts CMD + .(dot)

## SMB Mounter + Unmounter Server

Fast mounting smb network share. Please also refer to https://support.apple.com/en-bw/HT208209 for speedier SMBs on your Mac. This script mounts/unmounts a network-share to your desktop.

#### Please change the IP, Sharename, Username and Password inside the Script to make this work. Also change notification and keyword to  fit your needs :) ðŸ¦„

## Royal TSX

This awesome workflow works together with Royal TSX enabling searching and connecting to remote servers from Alfred.

![royaltsx](https://github.com/danielbahl/alfredv4/blob/master/royal-tsx-screenshot-1?raw=true)

### Ad-hoc

`royal rdp://1.2.4.5` created an ad-hoc remote desktop connection to IP 1.2.4.5.
`royal ssh://awesomeworkstation.com` created an ad-hoc SSH connection to IP 1.2.4.5.

### Search

`royal web01` search for web01 in your Royal Bookmarks. Press enter to open Royal TSX and connect.

### Direct Connections

Every morning I connect to a specific server, my workstation. That's why I've made a keyword called "workstation" that connects directly to a specific server in Royal. For this to work you'll need the UUID from Royal for this specific server. Therefore, I have made a Clipboard action that you can connecte the Royal keyword. Then use the Royal keywork to connect to the server, now you have the UUID in your clipboard. Now insert the UUID from your clipboard into the workstation workflow script.
